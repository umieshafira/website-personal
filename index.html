    <h1 style="color:tomato;">The things that I'm do during Movement Control Order</h1>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;At the beginining of MCO, my daily routine is sleeping, eating, watching television and playing games. I will repeat that activity everydays. I think this MCO period, I can marathon all kdrama that I not watch yet before the online class start. This is the list of kdrama that watched during MCO: </p>

    <ul>
    	<li>Iteawon Class</li>
    	<li>Crash Landing on You</li>
    	<li>Running Man</li>
    	<li>How to Buy A Friend</li>
    	<li>We Play</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;MCO continues untill phase 3. The online class starts on 14th April 2020 and the lecturer started give the new assessment. We didn't have a final but I have to face more indidual assignment. In addition, online is not easy for me because I have poor internet connection at my home. So, I hope this Corona virus will disappear as soon as possible.I also hope in this phase, the society will give a cooperation to solve this problem. So, this video is an example of precautions that you should take to avoid getting infected: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRCjl0_3sEs">Let's fight Covid-19</a></p>
